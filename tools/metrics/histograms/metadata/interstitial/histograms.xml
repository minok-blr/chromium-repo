  <summary>
    Possible non-attack causes of the non-overridable SSL interstitial. Many
    errors are not reported in this histogram and new errors may be added over
    time, therefore one should not look at the breakdown of this histogram (one
    bucket divided by the sum) because that will be inaccurate. Instead, one
    should look at each bucket count divided by the count of the ssl errors of
    that type. E.g. WWW mismatch is recorded only when the ssl error is
    CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID, so one should look at the bucket count of WWW
    mismatch divided by the bucket count of CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID in the
    histogram interstitial.ssl_error_type.
